# CS-210

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.

This project takes in sales from a grocery store and reads the contents. It gives the options of saying how many times each item was sold, how many times a particular item was sold or displaying a historgram of how many time each item was sold. 

# What did you do particularly well?

I handled errors really well in this code and made it flow well from start to finish.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?

To enchance the code, I could add more options to choose from like being able to choose data from multiple days. I also could add more functions to reduce code redundancies. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?

I found the error handling the most challenging. I overcame this by watching videos, reading articles and working with my professor to better understand the topic.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?

Error handling is a big thing that transfer to almost every project I work on in the furutre.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I added multiple comments within the code to explain what everything is supposed to do. I also included multiple functions to prevent code redundancies.
